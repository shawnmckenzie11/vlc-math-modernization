## How agents should use this

1. Read `frameworks/semester.json` before pacing, module calendars, or “what week is it?” planning.
2. Treat `current_phase` as authoritative: `preparing` | `in_session` | `exam` | `break`.
3. When the semester changes, update **both** `semester.json` and this file; see `agents/semester-context.md`.

## Updating semester state

1. Confirm board calendar (PDF or final published calendar).
2. Update dates and `current_phase` in `semester.json`.
3. Mirror the narrative summary here.
4. Optionally archive prior semester JSON under `frameworks/archive/`.
